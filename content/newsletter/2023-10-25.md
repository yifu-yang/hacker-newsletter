## 7. Show HN: Restaurants in Peace – leave a remembrance for a closed restaurant

gregsadetsky:Hey HN! I go a bit about the project on the about [0] page, but wanted to chime in here as well.<p>It’s been a project long in the making - it started in 2019, before everything shut down&#x2F;changed. The list of closed restaurants I found - for New York only - was already really long. So now (that I have time to work on it at recurse.com) it really felt like I needed to do something about it.<p>When a restaurant (or any business) shows up on Google Maps as “permanently closed”, in that bright red font, there’s always a tiny bit of a pang of sadness. It’s definitely more than a pang when you look for a place you loved and expected to visit again.<p>The project’s “aesthetic” is inspired by early 2000s funeral homes’ websites. The combination of funeral + restaurant is what made it click for me. Maybe what we long for is a place to share our losses? Maybe.<p>Thanks for checking it out! :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;restaurants.rip&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;restaurants.rip&#x2F;about</a>

## 9. Show HN: Dlt – Python library to automate the creation of datasets

MatthausK:Hi HN,<p>We&#x27;re Anna, Adrian, Marcin and Matt, developers of dlt. dlt is an open source library to automatically create datasets out of messy, unstructured data sources. You can use the library to move data from about anywhere into most of well known SQL and vector stores, data lakes, storage buckets, or local engines like DuckDB. It automates many cumbersome data engineering tasks and can by handled by anyone who knows Python.<p>Here’s our Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dlt-hub&#x2F;dlt">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dlt-hub&#x2F;dlt</a><p>Here’s our Colab demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1DhaKW0tiSTHDCVmPjM-eoyL47BJ30xmP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1DhaKW0tiSTHDCVmPjM-...</a><p>— — —<p>In the past we wrote hundreds of Python scripts to fit messy data sources into something that you can work with in Python - a database, Pandas frame or just a Python list. We were solving the same problems and making the similar mistakes again and again.<p>This is why we built an easy to use Python library called dlt that will automate most data engineering tasks. It hides the complexities of data loading and automatically generates a structured and clean datasets for immediate querying and sharing.<p>— — —<p>At its core, dlt removes the need to create the dataset schemas, react to changing data, generate append or merge statements, and to move the data in transactional and idempotent manner. Those things are automated and can be declared right in the Python code, just by decorating functions.<p>Add @dlt.resource decorator, give it a few hints, and convert any data into a simple pipeline that creates and updates datasets.<p>dlt gets the details out of your way:<p>1. You do not need to worry about the structure of a database or parquet files<p>dlt will create a nice, typed schema out of your data and will migrate it when the data changes. You can put some data contracts and Pydantic models on top to keep your data clean.<p>2. You do not need to write any INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE or data copy statements<p>dlt will push the data to DuckDB, Weaviate, storage buckets and many popular SQL stores. It will align the data types, file formats, and identifier names automatically<p>3. You do not need to worry when you need to add new data or update the changes.<p>dlt lets you declare how to load the data, how to increment it and will keep the loading state together so they are always in sync.<p>4. You keep how you develop and test your code<p>Iterate and test quickly on your laptop or in a dev container. Run locally on DuckDB and just swap destination name to go to the cloud - your code, schema and data will stay the same.<p>5. You can work with data on your laptop.<p>Combine dlt with other tools and libraries to process data locally. duckdb, Pandas, Arrow tables and Rust based loading libraries like ConnectorX work nicely with dlt and process data blazingly fast, compared to the cloud.<p>6. You do not need to worry if your pipeline will work when you deploy it.<p>dlt is a minimalistic Python library, requires no backend and works whenever Python works. You can finetune it to work on constrained environments like AWS Lambda or run with Airflow, GitHub Actions or Dagster.<p>dlt has an Apache 2.0 license. We plan to make money by offering organizations a paid control plane, where dlt users can track and policy what every pipeline does, manage schemas and contracts across organization, create data catalogues, and share them with the team members and customers.

## 26. Show HN: Fediverser Portal – Bring your subreddits to Lemmy

rglullis:This is my attempt at helping those who are trying to ditch reddit but have not been satisfied with the content from Lemmy or haven&#x27;t been able to find the corresponding communities.<p>There are two sides to this project. The first one is that I have setup a Lemmy instance (alien.top) which is mirroring some of the reddit content from subreddits that I wanted to follow <i>with the comments</i>. The difference from most mirroring bots is that, instead of one single bot account mirroring all content, the system creates one account for each reddit user that is being mirrored.<p>The <i>other</i> part of this idea which I believe is more interesting: reddit users can <i>take over</i> their own mirrored bot account on this Lemmy instance. The instance itself does not use the regular registration process, but instead authenticates via Reddit OAuth. If you login through through the &quot;Portal&quot;, we can then grab your subscribed subreddits and (when it can) find the corresponding Lemmy communities and subscribe you to those automatically. At the moment there are not that Lemmy communities that are being mirrored because I&#x27;ve been the sole user, but hopefully if more people sign-up, it will help to create the network effects and more instance admins will be interested in hosting these &quot;fediversed&quot; communities.<p>All of the code is open source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mushroomlabs&#x2F;fediverser">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mushroomlabs&#x2F;fediverser</a>) and I&#x27;m more than willing to help people getting their own instances if they don&#x27;t want to use alien.top itself.<p>Questions and any type of feedback is always welcome!
