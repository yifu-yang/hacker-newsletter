## 9. Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring to Build AI for UI Testing

Gabriel_h:Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.

## 13. Show HN: ScratchDB – Open-Source Snowflake on ClickHouse

memset:Hello! For the past year I’ve been working on a fully-managed data warehouse built on Clickhouse. I built this because I was frustrated with how much work was required to run an OLAP database in prod: re-writing my app to do batch inserts, managing clusters and needing to look up special CREATE TABLE syntax every time I made a change. I found pricing for other warehouses confusing (what is a “credit” exactly?) and worried about getting capacity-planning wrong.<p>I was previously building accounting software for firms with millions of transactions. I desperately needed to move from Postgres to an OLAP database but didn’t know where to start. I eventually built abstractions around Clickhouse: My application code called an insert() function but in the background I had to stand up Kafka for streaming, bulk loading, DB drivers, Clickhouse configs, and manage schema changes.<p>This was all a big distraction when all I wanted was to save data and get it back. So I decided to build a better developer experience around it. The software is open-source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scratchdata&#x2F;ScratchDB">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scratchdata&#x2F;ScratchDB</a> and and the paid offering is a hosted version: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scratchdb.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scratchdb.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>It&#x27;s called “ScratchDB” because the idea is to make it easy to get started from scratch. It’s a massively simpler abstraction on top of Clickhouse.<p>ScratchDB provides two endpoints [1]: one to insert data and another to query. When you send any JSON, it automatically creates tables and columns based on the structure [2]. Because table creation is automated, you can just start sending data and the system will just work [3]. It also means you can use Scratch as any webhook destination without prior setup [4,5]. When you query, just pass SQL as a query param and it returns JSON.<p>It handles streaming and bulk loading data. When data is inserted, I append it to a file on disk, which is then bulk loaded into Clickhouse. The overall goal is for the platform to automatically handle managing shards and replicas.<p>The whole thing runs on regular servers. Hetzner has become our cloud of choice, along with Backblaze B2 and SQS. It is written in Go. From an architecture perspective I try to keep things simple - want folks to make economical use of their servers.<p>So far ScratchDB has ingested about 2 TB of data and 4,000 requests&#x2F;second on about $100 worth of monthly server costs.<p>Feel free to download it and play around - if you’re interested in this stuff then I’d love to chat! Really looking for feedback on what is hard about analytical databases and what would make the developer experience easier!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;docs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;docs</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;flatten-json&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;flatten-json&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scratchdb-email-signups&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scratchdb-email-signups&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;stripe-data-ingest&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;stripe-data-ingest&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shopify-data-ingest&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shopify-data-ingest&#x2F;</a>

## 23. Show HN: A local Python prototyping tool for Jupyter and Streamlit

galenmarchetti:Hey HN! I built a local Python prototyping tool that is finally the Python development environment I&#x27;ve always wanted.<p>It has a Jupyter notebook for data crunching, a database of your choice (Python or MongoDB), and a Streamlit app for building a frontend visualization. You can edit the Streamlit backend via an embedded VSCode editor, or locally on your own IDE.<p>The best part for me is that the database connectors within Jupyter and Streamlit are configured out-of-the-box, so you don&#x27;t need to spend time thinking about how to tie all that together - you can just pick the database you want to use and get going.<p>Disclaimer: I do also work on the tool that deploys all this under the hood, but this project is a personal hackweek project that I threw together so I could develop Python apps on my own
