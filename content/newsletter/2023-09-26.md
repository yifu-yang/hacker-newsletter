## 8. Show HN: Minum – A minimal Java web framework

7ep:I am happy to announce my minimalist zero-dependency web framework, Minum, is out of beta.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;byronka&#x2F;minum">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;byronka&#x2F;minum</a><p>You will be hard-pressed to find another modern project as obsessively minimalistic.  Other frameworks will claim simplicity and minimalism and then, casually, mention they are built on a multitude of libraries. This follows self-imposed constraints, predicated on a belief that smaller and lighter is long-term better.<p>Caveat emptor: This is a project by and for developers who know and like programming (rather than, let us say, configuring).  It is written in Java, and presumes familiarity with the HTTP&#x2F;HTML paradigm.<p>Driving paradigms of this project:<p>* ease of use
* maintainability &#x2F; sustainability
* simplicity
* performance
* good documentation
* good testing<p>It requires Java 21, for its virtual threads (Project Loom)

## 18. Show HN: DitchTheBell – Linux-based desktop notifier for RSS/Atom feeds

Escher21:Ditch The Bell is a desktop notifier for RSS&#x2F;Atom feeds that lets you closely configure features of the freedesktop notification specification to unlock the most customizable feed notification experience possible on Linux.<p>I developed this program because I wanted a single, centralized location to easily manage my desktop notifications for all of the various websites I want to get updates from. Before creating this application, I found existing solutions unsatisfactory due to the following reasons:<p>- Built-In Notification Services: Some websites offer built-in desktop notification services, but these often require an account, staying signed in, and running a browser service worker continuously on your PC.<p>- RSS Readers: While existing RSS readers with notification support provide a simple solution, these project balance numerous aspects of reader development. Notifications and their configurations are usually not the priority in these projects.<p>- Custom Scripting: Implementing custom scripts using general-purpose notification tools like notify-send or GObject-Introspection is viable but becomes a maintenance headache as more granular control is introduced.<p>These alternatives are sufficient for basic notifications but lack the lightweight nature and advanced configurability that power users desire. Ditch The Bell fills this gap, offering granular control over your RSS feed notifications without the limitations of the approaches mentioned above.<p>Check it out!: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EscherMoore&#x2F;DitchTheBell">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EscherMoore&#x2F;DitchTheBell</a>
