## 18. Ask HN: I'm a SWE without a CS degree. Will online certs help me get into FAANG?

jdjdjdjdjdjd:I studied humanities in university. But I&#x27;ve been programming since I was a kid, so it was a natural career choice. I regret not doing CS. I work for a public sector org and have been promoted to a senior developer.<p>But I still don&#x27;t think this is enough for me to make the move to FAANG or other tech companies unless I stay here for a long time to rack up experience (I only have 2 years SWE experience at this point). Also, as the org I work for is not a tech company, I&#x27;m not sure how seriously recruiters will take my time here.<p>I&#x27;ve studied data structures and algorithms, and I think I am a decent programmer. I could probably progress quite quickly through CS50 or some other online course. I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s beneficial.<p>This topic online is full of misinformation and people just trying to sell you a course. So this seemed a good place to ask.<p>I&#x27;m UK-based by the way.<p>Thanks.

## 20. Show HN: Mana Pool – Market for Magic Cards

andrewljohnson:Hi folks. I launched my first startup on HN 15 years ago (see my profile), and I wanted to post here again now.<p>Like my last one, this project comes from one of my life&#x27;s passions. I have played Magic: The Gathering for 30 years.<p>My co-founders and I think Magic deserves its own market, and this thinking will lead to dozens of ways to make a great app. We consider what we have an MVP, and we are all going to MagicCon this weekend in Las Vegas to walk around in our Mana Pool shirts and talk to people about the future.<p>If HN likes the site, I would appreciate you crashing it before we head out tomorrow night!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manapool.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manapool.com&#x2F;</a>

## 27. Show HN: ElectricSQL, Postgres to SQLite active-active sync for local-first apps

samwillis:Hi HN, James, Valter, Sam and the team from ElectricSQL here.<p>We&#x27;re really excited to be sharing ElectricSQL with you today. It&#x27;s an open source, local-first sync layer that can be used to build reactive, realtime, offline-capable apps directly on Postgres with two way active-active sync to SQLite (including with WASM in the browser).<p>Electric comprises a sync layer (built with Elixir) placed in front of your Postgres database and a type safe client that allows you to bidirectionally sync data from your Postgres to local SQLite databases. This sync is CRDT-based, resilient to conflicting edits from multiple nodes at the same time, and works after being offline for extended periods.<p>Some good links to get started:<p>- website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com</a><p>- docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs</a><p>- code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;electric-sql&#x2F;electric">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;electric-sql&#x2F;electric</a><p>- introducing post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;20&#x2F;introducing-electricsql-v0.6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;20&#x2F;introducing-electri...</a><p>You can also see some demo applications:<p>- Linear clone: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linear-lite.electric-sql.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linear-lite.electric-sql.com</a><p>- Realtime demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;multi-user" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;multi-user</a><p>- Conflict-free offline: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;offline" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;offline</a><p>The Electric team actually includes two of the inventors of CRDTs, Marc Shapiro and Nuno Preguiça, and a number of their collaborators who&#x27;ve pioneered a lot of tech underpinning local-first software. We are privileged to be building on their research and delighted to be surfacing so much work in a product you can now try out.
