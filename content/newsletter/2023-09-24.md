## 11. Show HN: Karektar – Bitmap Font Designer

newtrino:Karektar is a React&#x2F;TS app for building exportable bitmap fonts from custom glyph sets.<p>You can submit your own input string, and the app will generate the gallery of unique glyphs. Build your own designs using the various tools available, then export it to an OTF format when you&#x27;re done.<p>This is my first front-end project, and one I picked up to learn React. I&#x27;d love to hear any feedback, especially on usability and additional features you&#x27;d like to see. Cheers!

## 30. Show HN: I rewrote the 1990's LambdaMOO server

cmrdporcupine:I got my start on the Internet in the very early 90s playing with, authoring in, and programming on LambdaMOO (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LambdaMOO" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LambdaMOO</a>) and similar systems. Shared virtual social spaces, with a persistent object oriented authoring &#x2F; scripting language. They can be classified as MUDs (depending on who you talk to) but the focus is social, creative &#x2F; authoring, and shared programming not RPG gaming.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to see this kind of thing modernized and further developed. Over the last 25 years or so I&#x27;ve worked on similar but novel &amp; improved things, but never finished.<p>So I decided to just re-implement LambdaMOO and use that as a base, instead and keep compatibility as a goal, but build it out on a more modern foundation that takes advantage of multiple core machines, newer network protocols, newer connectivity methods, uses MVCC transactions for the shared database etc.<p>LambdaMOO is a somewhat extensive system in that it is composed of compiler, a virtual machine, an object database, user permissions system, network runtime. In some ways it&#x27;s kind of like a shared, text-based Smalltalk image&#x2F;runtime... So quite a bit to implement and get right before it all works together.<p>The big challenge throughout has been slavishly maintaining backwards compatibility so existing &quot;cores&quot; (databases) work.<p>It&#x27;s not done, but it&#x27;s darn close. Would like for people who are into this kind of thing to check it out, and maybe even help.<p>Many of the technical aspects here are still provisional, but this is the start. Constructive assistance welcome.<p>(Yes, it&#x27;s a rewrite in Rust, but that&#x27;s not really the point, even though that&#x27;s a cliche that&#x27;s fun.)
