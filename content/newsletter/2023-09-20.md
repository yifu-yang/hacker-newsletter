## 19. Show HN: Liz – Collaborative Lisp coding on Discord

D4ckard:This is a Discord bot I made, which lets you write and evaluate Lisp code in collaborative sessions on Discord.<p>I wrote it in a short amount of time, partly for learning purposes, but also because I found the idea exciting and it was fun to hack around.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to get your feedback, especially on how to improve the deletion mechanism (maybe make deletion sexpr-based?). I&#x27;ve tried to make the README detailed enough so that it&#x27;s easy to make some changes and run your own version.

## 22. Show HN: A reference implementation of Turing's paper “On Computable Numbers”

jekude:Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been curious about the history of computer science and decided to try to read Turing&#x27;s 1936 paper where he conceptualizes the Turing Machine, etc.<p>I had trouble understanding the paper, read The Annotated Turing by Charles Petzold (which is wonderful), but felt that reading a reference implementation would help formalize my understanding. When I couldn&#x27;t find an open source implementation, I decided to write my own.<p>The implementation includes:<p><pre><code>  - Abbreviated tables (m-functions)
  - Conversions to Standard Descriptions and Description Numbers
  - A working universal machine
  - A walkthrough of the paper section-by-section in the context of the codebase
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m still working on sections 8-11 (the math&#x2F;logic is a bit difficult for me) - if you understand these sections well enough to explain, I&#x27;d love to talk to you!<p>In general I am interested in new mediums for learning source material (web annotations, walkthroughs, reference implementations, etc.), and was inspired by Karpathy&#x27;s Zero to Hero course in particular for this project.

## 29. Show HN: Symphony – Use GPT-4 to call functions in sequence

jrmyphlmn:Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m excited to introduce Symphony – a toolkit designed to help developers write functions and let GPT-4 call them in whatever sequence that makes most sense based on conversation.<p>I&#x27;ve been quite amazed[1] by GPT-4&#x27;s recent ability to both detect when a function needs to be called and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function&#x27;s signature.<p>Since developers currently append descriptions of functions to API calls[2], I often found myself wishing for a toolkit that would automatically create these descriptions as I added and debugged functions during development.<p>You can get started by cloning the repository and adding functions by following the guide at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symphony.run&#x2F;docs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symphony.run&#x2F;docs</a><p>As of now, the toolkit supports functions in TypeScript. I&#x27;ll be adding support for more languages and features based on your feedback :)<p>[1] - Symphony Showcase: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symphony.run&#x2F;showcase" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symphony.run&#x2F;showcase</a><p>[2] - Function calling and other API updates from OpenAI: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;function-calling-and-other-api-updates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;function-calling-and-other-api-updat...</a>
