## 15. Ask HN: Anyone Using MacBook Air M2 24GB for Developement?

gls2ro:I am planning to change my Macbook as it is old and Intel-based.<p>Current problems:
- Cannot do Video calls with share screen - live coding - because it gets throttled
- Cannot use both laptop display and external monitor - because it gets throttled<p>I have an external fan that I use to be able to do serious work. The current laptop has 64GB of RAM, but I don&#x27;t think RAM is the issue.<p>I am considering buying a MacBook Air 15 with 24GB because I want to carry something light as I have back pain.<p>So my question is: 
- If you are using MacBook Air M2 for development, what are you running on, and did you encounter any issues?<p>I am concerned about it being fanless and, thus, probably going easy to throttle.

## 25. Show HN: I built a virtual tabletop for playing Dungeons and Dragons

YakiSauce:Diceright is a virtual tabletop for playing dungeons and dragons with friends on the web.  You can watch a quick overview of how it works here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;diceright" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;diceright</a>.  And there’s a list of the main features right on the homepage.<p>It’s a Ruby on Rails site that makes heavy use of action cable for keeping the maps and tokens in sync for all players.  On the front end, I’m using HTML canvas for the maps and a js library called fabric.js for interacting with the canvas.  Otherwise, just jQuery on the front end.  I optimized it all to work on mobile too.<p>I built this as a side project for fun over of the past couple years.  It took a lot longer than expected, but it was also a lot of fun.  I did all the design &#x2F; UX for it too which was a struggle at first but was a great learning experience.<p>Let me know what you think and if you have any questions.  Thanks!
