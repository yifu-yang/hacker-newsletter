## 22. Show HN: Timbre – An app that finds the best sounds for your sleep

bryan-vh:Hey all, I&#x27;m currently a solo iOS developer who just released my first app, Timbre, onto the App Store (iPhone only for now). Here&#x27;s a demo to show you how it works: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ALoPAFb31Bk">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ALoPAFb31Bk</a>.<p>Timbre originally came about because I wanted to build a sleep sounds &amp; sleep tracker app. I had used Headspace, Calm, Pillow, etc. and figured that instead of paying $70 &#x2F; year I could just build my own app and pay $100 &#x2F; year (not a great plan in retrospect). As I started building Timbre, I realized that one of the biggest issues I had with these other apps is that I could never really see which sounds genuinely helped me sleep. With that in mind, I pivoted on my original idea and decided to really hone in on connecting sleep quality and sounds.<p>Using a custom ML model, Apple&#x27;s CoreML framework and HealthKit&#x27;s sleep stage data, I made it so that Timbre could calculate a personal sleep quality score. Therefore, when you record a sleep session while listening to a sound, the app can rank the sounds you&#x27;ve listened to based on your sleep quality scores over time.<p>Of course, the app also has a smart alarm, offline support, sleep analysis and more, but I&#x27;d love to get some feedback &amp; suggestions from the demo video. Also feel free to ask me any questions and I&#x27;d be happy to answer them!
