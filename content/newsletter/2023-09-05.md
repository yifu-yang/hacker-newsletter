## 11. Show HN: Keep – GitHub Actions for your monitoring tools

talboren:Hi Hacker News! Shahar and Tal from Keep here.<p>A few months ago, we introduced here at HN (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34806482">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34806482</a>) Keep as an “open source alerting CLI” and got some interesting feedback - mainly around UI, automation, and supporting more tools. We were VERY early back then, and we understood that although the current DX around creating alerts is not great, it&#x27;s not that critical and developers don’t need another tool just for that.<p>But we did find something else.<p>While talking to developers and devops, we found that a lot of companies use many tools that generate alerts - from Cloudwatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to tools such as Zabbix or Nagios. We definitely agree consolidation in the observability space is a real thing, but while talking to those companies we feel that there are still real use cases for having more than one tool (and for example, according to Grafana’s 2023 observability survey, 52% of the companies uses more than 6 observability tools <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;observability-survey-2023&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;observability-survey-2023&#x2F;</a>).<p>So we that in mind, we rebuilt Keep with a simple mindset: (1) Integrate with every tool that triggers alerts - it can be either pushing alerts to Keep via webhooks or routing policies or Keep to pull alerts via the tools API. (2) Create a simple abstraction layer to run workflows on top of these alerts. (3) Maintain a great developer experience - open source, API-first, workflows as code and generally having a developer mindset while building Keep.<p>During the time we rebuilt Keep, Datadog released their workflow automation tool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datadoghq.com&#x2F;service_management&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datadoghq.com&#x2F;service_management&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;</a>) which led us to the understanding that&#x27;s exactly what we solve - but for everyone who uses tools other than Datadog.<p>A short demo of Keep with a simple use case: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FPMRCZM8ZYg">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FPMRCZM8ZYg</a><p>You can try it yourself by signing into <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.keephq.dev">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.keephq.dev</a><p>Like always - we invite you to try Keep and we are eager to hear any feedback.
