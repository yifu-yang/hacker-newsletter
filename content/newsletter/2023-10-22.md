## 27. HN RSS feeds per user no longer available

sarcher:Not sure how long these feeds have been broken, just noticed today. I used per-user RSS feeds to follow a few posters who generally write on subjects I&#x27;m interested in, but now they aren&#x27;t resolving.<p>Typically used this format:
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;userfeed&#x2F;&lt;username&gt;<p>Is there an alternative available or is the RSS option gone permanently?

## 30. Tell HN: 3G sunsetting is remotely killing every Subaru Outback battery

siftrics:Subaru partnered with a service called STARLINK which shares your location in the event of collisions, among other things.<p>STARLINK intermittently tries to phone home by hitting 3G towers.<p>Now that 3G is shutting down, the digital communications module (DCM) gets stuck in an infinite loop of<p>1. Phone home, expending battery charge
2. Fail, because 3G doesn&#x27;t work anymore
3. Go back to step 1<p>This effectively remotely drains the battery of every Subaru Outback  built between 2015 and 2020.<p>Even if you drive your car every day, its battery will die and you won&#x27;t be able to start it.<p>Other models are probably affected, too.<p>There was a class action lawsuit. But this is a pretty egregious engineering oversight, given they were still producing defective cars in 2020, hardly two years before 3G flipped off.<p>Will a brand ever produce a reliable, mechanical car? Why should 3G towers have anything to do with my car being able to start?
